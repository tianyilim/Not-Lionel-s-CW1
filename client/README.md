# Webpage
This is the webpage app for Imperial College's Embedded System CW1. 

## Usage
Node.js is required to be installed for running the script. (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Dependencies of the script can installed by `npm install` <br>

Running the script: <br>
```
npm start
```
A webpage would be hosted on `http://localhost:3000/`. This is currently still in development mode. In the final product, separately starting up of the React dev Server would not be needed.
